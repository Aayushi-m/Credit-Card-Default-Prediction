This repository has files related to Credit Card Default prediction project done using Machine Learning. 
With the growing numbers of credit card users the default rate is also increasing which is jeopardizing the banking sector. So to tackle this growing problem the world needs solutions and one of it is
to try and predict in time which customer can result in a default. Different Machine Learning algorithms were applied to see which of them give the best result for default prediction.
